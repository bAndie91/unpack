# Project issues, bugs, feature requests, ideas

1. clone the repo
2. use [git-bug](https://github.com/git-bug/git-bug) to open a new ticket in this repo
3. find one or more person in the commit history to make contact with, then either

   a. send the URL of your git clone to the other contributor(s), via E-mail or other channel, 
   requesting them to pull (`git-bug` issues and/or branches as well) from you.
   This is the preferred way, since it's easier to update your ticket, amend changes, and/or contibute later on.
   
   b. or, if you don't provide your repo's location, send your newly created `git-bug` ticket (or patch if you already propose a code change) via E-mail.
